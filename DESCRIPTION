Description: Byte order marks (BOM) appear at the beginning of a file or buffer and 
    provide information about the encoding of the contents. R provides facilities to 
    work with files and connections with BOMs but there are situatons where these 
    facilities are not sufficient. Tools are provided to identify the presence and
    type of byte order marks in files and R objects as well as remove them.
